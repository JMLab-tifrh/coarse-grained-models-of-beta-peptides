Author list: Jagannath Mondal, Jaya Krishna Koneru, Dube Dheeraj Prakashchand, Namita Dube


Models of two sequence-isomers (GA and non-GA) of 10-residue beta-peptide Y-(ACHC-ACHC-K)3 are provided. 
The models are parametertized using MARTINI coarse-grained frame-work.
Uploaded topology and parameter files of both sequence-isomers are formatted for simulation using GROMACS. Also uploaded  sample configuration file (in .gro format) of single copy of peptide in presence of phospholipid bilayers.
